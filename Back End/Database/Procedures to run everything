Load SQLite3 database
==================
- sqlite3 soap.db  (creates soap.db if one doesn't already exist, uses soap.db if it exists)
- .read soap.sql (once sqlite3 prompt appears)
- .tables (make sure all tables are in the DB)
- .schema (want to see schema)

Run the Java Program
==================
- javac Project_CommandLine.java
- java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.15.1.jar" Project_CommandLine soap.db
- Specify the CSV file
- Run queries
- Quit program when desired

Make sure all previous soap.sql files are removed and that the most recent soap.sql file is used.
